# Fuyuki【 冬木 】
A brutally minimalist and totally not lazy designed hugo theme for those who just want a simple theme to start writing wherever the hell they want, but still want to keep organized, maybe.

Powered by the legendary Tailwind CSS and the beautiful coldness of Nord color Palette. Its perfect, atleast, for me though.

Still in early development, lets see if this project gonna dead like my other private project or not.

## Stacks Used

- Tailwind CSS
- Tailwind-nord
- Nord Color Palette
- Hugo
- Raleway & Lato Fonts

## Philosophy 

> "I can' find my desired hugo theme for my blog. Well then, i'm gonna make it myself." — Me, after surfing through themes.gohugo.io

And with that, poof! This thing came out. I'm sure it will be fine **looking at my other project who never finished.* ehe~
